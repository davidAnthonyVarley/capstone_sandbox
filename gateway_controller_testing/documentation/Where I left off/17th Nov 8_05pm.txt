Current problem: Exposing the UDP port on localhost

The port forwarding worked for HTTP 1.1 and 2, but not for UDP

Therefore, while my app is running inside the pod (i think, there hasn't been any crashing), I can't query it like I did before with the lower version of HTTP

So right now, I need to find a way to just hit a UDP port from the cluster that is exposed to my local machine
