1. i created a local webtransport client and server to verify that my client worked correctly
    this worked as expected when i made a request

2. i sent a request from the client to the gateway. the gateway didn't even log this request. this was unlike when i would send UDP via UDPRoute and it would break
    similarly, when i tried to send HTTP/3, with a UDP backendRef, it did log that request (and its subsequent failure)

3. I edited the HTTPRoute to explicitly allow Extended CONNECT requests, but I got the same result as before 

4. I tried to insert this into hte bootstrap config for envoy;
"
http3_protocol_options:
  allow_extended_connect: true   # Allows the special WebTransport CONNECT method
upgrade_configs:
  - upgrade_type: webtransport    # Permits the protocol upgrade
"
I linked the envoy proxy configuration to the gateway class

"
metadata:
  annotations:
    gateway.envoyproxy.io/extension-types: envoyproxy
    gateway.envoyproxy.io/extension-ref-name: webtransport-config # Matches your EnvoyProxy name
"

after verifying these three steps had worked as intended, I faced the same issues as before. I determined that any further work required to get WT working would be
a) very coupled to envoy and perhaps not generalisable across other gateway api implementations
b) time consuming
c) somewhat out of scope
d) not even that useful, as i want to focus on comparing HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3

Therefore, I decided to leave it at that
